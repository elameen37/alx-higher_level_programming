# 0x13 Javascript - Objects, Scopes and Closures :roller_coaster:

> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. This project covers programming objects as well as closures. OOP programming! :)

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:
  
* How to create an object in Javascript
* What this means
* What undefined means
* Why the variable type and scope is important
* What is a closure
* What is a prototype
* How to inherit an object from another

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Class Rectangle that defines a rectangle 
1. Class Rectangle that defines a rectangle v2
2. Class Rectangle that defines a rectangle v3
3. Class Rectangle that defines a rectangle v4
4. Class Rectangle that defines a rectangle v5
5. Class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js
6. Class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js
7. Function that returns the number of occurrences in a list
8. Function that returns the reversed version of a list
9. Function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value
10. Function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument
11. Script that imports an array and computes a new array.
12. Script that imports a dictionary of occurrences by user id and computes a dictionary of user ids by occurrence.
13. Script that concats 2 files.
