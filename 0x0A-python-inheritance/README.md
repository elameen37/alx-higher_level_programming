# 0x0A Python - Inheritance :snake:

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers OOP in python with more complex scripts.
