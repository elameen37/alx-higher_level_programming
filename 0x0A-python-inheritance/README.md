# 0x0A Python - Inheritance :snake:

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers OOP in python with more complex scripts.

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object
1. Class MyList that inherits from list
2. Function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False.
3. Function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False.
4. Function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False.
5. Empty class BaseGeometry.
6. Class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py).
7. Class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py).
8. Class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py).
9. Class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py). (task based on 8-rectangle.py)
10. Class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py)
11. Class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py). (task based on 10-square.py).
12. Class MyInt that inherits from int
13. Function that adds a new attribute to an object if it’s possible
